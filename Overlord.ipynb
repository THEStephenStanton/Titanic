    "**Objective:** Create a model to predict who would and who would not have survived the titanic. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's frame this problem:\n",
    "* This is a **supervised learning problem** due to the fact that we have been given the correct labels (survived or not)\n",
    "* This is a **classification task** given that we are just trying to predict whether someone survived or not\n",
    "* This is a **batch learning** problem since the dataset is small enough to be kept in memory and we don't have new information coming in.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will be using **classification error** as my performance measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions:**\n",
    "I think that there will be 3 features that could really determine whether someone would have survived or not:\n",
    "1.  **Sex**, because women were prioritized in the evacuation\n",
    "2.  **Age**, because children were also prioritized in the evacuation\n",
    "3.  **Pclass** (Ticket class), because those who were wealthier probably had more pull to try to get off the ship first over the poor people\n",
    "\n",
    "Another other minor assumptions that I had are that people higher up on the boat (the **Cabin** feature) would be more likely to survive since when the ship hit the iceburg, obviously the lower level cabins would get hit first.  I am not sure if the **Cabin** feature could help us with this, **Pclass** might help in the same exact way since most of the nicer and more expensive cabins are high up the boat.  "

With 1, I would guess that more times than not, this would be the spouse.  With 0, the survival rate seems to be about what the average survival rate was for the whole titanic.  Which makes sense since the overwhelming majority of people have no spouses or siblings on the ship.  But with 1 the survival average seems to go up quite a bit.  The only explanation for this might be because a woman was prioritized to get off the boat first and maybe they had children which prioritized them even more?  We will look more into this when we look at **Parch** next.\n",

I thought that **Cabin** could be a cool feature to do stuff with because if we could find the layout of the ship somewhere online, we could maybe determine where the room was in relation to how far away from the hole in the ship it was.  As we saw before, the reason that a lot of people in 3rd class probably died is because they would be lower on the ship.  Now, not all of them died, knowing where their cabin was on the ship could contribute to how likely they were to survive.  They could have been really far from where the ship had a hole in it giving them more time to get to the top of the deck.  Unfortunately, this feature is missing a TON of values.  So we will just be dropping it."
